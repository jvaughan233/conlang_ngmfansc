# conlang_ngmfansc
A test: hosting everything with a repo

#### About 
This is an attempt to put a conlang on Github (which is certainly something Github not designed for) and exploit its Wiki functionalities (to accomodate guides and grammatical references and so on).
If this doesn't work, see ya on FrathWiki (perhaps).
